  <p>As immense and vast amounts of data are created and stored by users’ of computer technology everyday, there is an increasingly large target that bad actors will attempt to attack. While many simple techniques are available to lend broad
    protection to this sensitive information, little and sometimes no action is taken by users and companies globally. The effects of these shortcomings can be disastrous. We see major data breach occurring — one after another. And with little
    intervention or resolution by the state, it seems we are left to fend for ourselves.</p>
